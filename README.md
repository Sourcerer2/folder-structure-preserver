# folder-structure-preserver
Nicotine+ plugin that keeps original file paths.

Downloading a folder will keep the original folder structure of the downloded files, but what if you want to only download individual files?
Nicotine+ will place them in the root download directory and the original path to the remote file will be lost.
This plugin solves that problem by moving any downloaded files into a folder structure that matches their path from the source.
